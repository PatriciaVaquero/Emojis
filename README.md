# Hello everyone out there!

First of all, welcome to my GitHub Account, which it is mantained by **Patricia Rodríguez Vaquero**. I would like my GitHub Account to have different topics. I would like to cover a lot of themes, but I've finally decided to go over the ones shortlisted below:


- 💡 Ideas & Self-motivation. 

- 📌 Messages & Reminders. 

- ⚠️ Important. 

- 💻 Programming + Nerd World. 

- 🔬 Investigation / Reports
